<h1><span style="font-weight:400;">Metabolism</span></h1>
<b>Metabolism: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">The totality of an organism’s chemical reactions</span>

<b>Catabolic pathways: </b><b>Releases energy</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> (</span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">exergonic)</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> by breaking down complex molecules into simpler compounds - the energy becomes available to do work in the cell “downhill” reaction</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;"> <em>ex. </em>Cellular respiration, the breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen, is an example of a pathway of catabolism</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">C</span><span style="font-weight:400;">6</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> H</span><span style="font-weight:400;">12</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> + 6CO</span><span style="font-weight:400;">2</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> → 6CO</span><span style="font-weight:400;">2</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> + 6H</span><span style="font-weight:400;">2</span><span style="font-weight:400;">O + ATP</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">The reaction is exergonic because it releases energy in the form of ATP</span>

<b>Anabolic pathways:</b> <b>Consumes energy</b> <i><span style="font-weight:400;">(endergonic)</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> to build complex molecules for simpler ones.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;"><em>ex</em>. The synthesis of protein from amino acids is an example of anabolism</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">These two pathways intersect so that energy released from “downhill” reactions can be used to drive “uphill” reactions. </span><b>This transfer of energy from catabolism to anabolism is called </b><b>energy coupling.</b>
<h1><span style="font-weight:400;">Energy</span></h1>
<b>Energy: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">The capacity to cause change.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Energy exists in various forms, some of which can perform work. Heat (thermal energy) cannot perform work because heating up the cell denatures proteins, so you can’t heat up the cell.</span>

<b>Kinetic energy: </b><span style="font-weight:400;"> energy associated with motion</span>

<b>Heat (thermal energy): </b><span style="font-weight:400;"> kinetic energy associated with random movement of atoms or molecules</span>

<b>Potential energy:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> energy that matter possesses because of its location or structure</span>

<b>Chemical energy: </b><span style="font-weight:400;"> potential energy available for release in a chemical reaction.</span>

<b>Energy can be converted from one form into another.</b>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Free Energy</span></h2>
<b>Free energy: </b><span style="font-weight:400;"> A living system’s free energy is energy that can do work when temperature and pressure are uniform, as in a living cell.</span>
<ul>
	<li><b>Only processes with a negative ∆G</b></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Spontaneous processes can be harnessed to perform work</span></li>
</ul>

<b>The concept of free energy can be applied to the chemistry of life’s processes.</b>

<b>Exergonic reactions: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">Reactions that proceed with a </span><b>net</b><b> release of free energy</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> and occur spontaneously. </span><b>The amount of free energy in the molecule decreases</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> (because it is being released) and the stability of a system increases.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;"> <em>ex. </em> C</span><span style="font-weight:400;">6</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> H</span><span style="font-weight:400;">12</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> + 6CO</span><span style="font-weight:400;">2</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> → 6CO</span><span style="font-weight:400;">2</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> + 6H</span><span style="font-weight:400;">2</span><span style="font-weight:400;">O</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">∆G = - 686 kcal/mol  → all of the energy is released in small parts b/c there is too much energy to be released at once</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">For each mole of glucose broken down, 686 kcal of energy is made available for work.</span>

<b>Endergonic reactions: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">Reactions that </span><b>absorb energy</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> from surroundings and stores it in molecules. ∆G is positive (with the amount of energy put in and stored.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">These reactions are nonspontaneous and the quantity of energy needed to drive the reaction is represented by ∆G.</span>

<em>ex.</em> For photosynthesis to produce one molecule of glucose from CO2 and H2O, 686 kcal/mole is required (in the form of light energy)

<h1><span style="font-weight:400;">Metabolic Disequilibrium</span></h1>
<b>A cell that has reached equilibrium can do no work - the cell is dead.</b>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">An open system of a cell maintains a disequilibrium.</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Some reversible reactions in cell respiration are constantly being pulled in one direction because the </span><span style="font-weight:400;">products of one reaction are the reactants of the other</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Energy coupling is mediated by ATP</span></li>
</ul>
<b>ATP: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">Adenine, Ribose, and three phosphates</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The bonds between phosphates are called “high energy” but they are actually quite weak</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The bonds are unstable and hydrolysis (breaking up the molecule) yields energy - the products are more stable than ATP</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight:400;">ATP is ionized in the cell. The negative charges on the phosphates are crowded together, but they also repel each other due to ionization, which contributes to the instability in ATP. It is a “loaded spring”.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">ATP Performing Work</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">When hydrolysis of ATP occurs </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">in the test tube</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, the energy released is released as heat. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">However</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, if energy was released as heat in </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">the cell</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, that would be inefficient and dangerous.</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Heating a cell can cause the proteins in it to denature, which is renders them useless</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Phosphorylation:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> ATP drives endergonic reactions by phosphorylation, transferring a phosphate group to some other molecule, such as a reactant. The recipient molecule is now </span><b>phosphorylated.</b>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Phosphorylated intermediate is more reactive. The free energy is required to phosphorylate ADP comes from catabolic reactions in the cell</span></li>
</ul>
<h1><span style="font-weight:400;">Enzymes</span></h1>
<b><i>A spontaneous chemical reaction may occur slowly.</i></b>
<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:none;">
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Adding enzymes to the solution speeds up the reactions. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><b>Enzymes speed up reactions by lowering energy barriers</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Catalyst: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">Chemical agent that changes rate of a reaction without being consumed; an enzyme is a catalytic protein (ribozymes are made up of RNA and are biological catalysts)</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;"> <em>ex. </em>H</span><span style="font-weight:400;">2</span><span style="font-weight:400;">O</span><span style="font-weight:400;">2</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> → hydrogen peroxide (a chemical that cleans wounds)</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Hydrogen peroxide cleans wounds by killing bacteria cells, but if left in the body it would kill skin cells</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The enzyme catalase speeds up the breakdown of H</span><span style="font-weight:400;">2</span><span style="font-weight:400;">O</span><span style="font-weight:400;">2</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> into H</span><span style="font-weight:400;">2</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> and O</span><span style="font-weight:400;">2</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, which are accepted by the cell</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Activation Energy Barrier</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Every reaction involves both bond breaking and bond forming. It is the </span><b>net</b><b> energy</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> at the end that </span><b>determines whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic</b><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Reactant molecules must absorb energy from their surroundings for bonds to break and energy is released when new bonds are formed.</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The absorption of energy increases the speed of reactant molecules so that they collide more forcefully and often</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">As molecules settle into a more stable bonding arrangement, energy is released</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Ea (Activation energy): </b><span style="font-weight:400;">The amount of energy needed to push reactants over the energy barrier so “downhill” portion of the reaction can begin.</span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-213" src="https://apbiology387631959.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/screen-shot-2018-01-04-at-2-34-10-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-01-04 at 2.34.10 PM.png" width="556" height="391" />

<b>An enzyme speeds a reaction by lowering Ea so that the transition state can be reached at a moderate temperature.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> A single enzyme molecule can act on a thousand substrate molecules per second. Some enzymes are much faster. </span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Most reactions are reversible </span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">An enzyme can catalyze both forward and reverse reactions</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Which one depends on relative concentrations of reactants and products.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
