<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>Welcome to apbiology! This site is an amalgamation of my experience and learning in the AP Biology course throughout the 2017-2018 school year.

Here you can find all of my notes with the related textbook chapters in the AP Campbell Biology Tenth Edition book, science stories that I find interesting, and pictures and stories about the labs I have completed as a part of my course this year.

There is also a contact page should you wish to message me with any questions about AP Biology content.

I hope students in the course can find this content helpful in revising and succeeding in their own AP Biology course.</p>
